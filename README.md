This is a custom remake of the original Raspberry Pi Video Car Robot code

My version of the code controlls the robot through SSL encrypted (self signed)

POST form requests instead of GET requests, and includes Apache server authenication. 

GET requests are just URL directories which are visible, while POST requests also include a form,

which can be encrypted through SSL (along with authenication).
